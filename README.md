# US Adult Obesity Trends — Overview & Socioeconomic Disparities (Last 5 Years)

## Project Summary
This project analyzes adult obesity trends in the United States using publicly available CDC BRFSS data.  
The dashboard supports **population health analysis** by examining temporal trends and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and overweight prevalence across key demographic groups. The analysis is exploratory in nature and avoids causal inference.

## Data Source
**CDC BRFSS — Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Dataset**  
- Population: Adults aged ≥18 years  
- Geography: All 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.  
- Time window: Last five available years (2020–2024)  
- Measures: Obesity prevalence (%), overweight prevalence (%), confidence intervals, sample size  
- Stratifications: Income, education, race/ethnicity, sex, age

## Tools Used
- Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public (dashboard design and visualization)
- In-tool aggregation and validation

## Key Analytical Insights
- Adult obesity prevalence has shown a consistent upward trend over the last five years.
- Higher-income groups exhibit lower obesity prevalence, though upward trends are observed across income categories over time.
- Individuals with a college education demonstrate lower obesity prevalence, while overweight prevalence remains substantial.
- Despite increased global awareness around health and wellness, obesity prevalence continues to rise across multiple population groups. This suggests a gap between information availability and sustained population-level behavior change, underscoring the need for deeper epidemiological analysis of social, behavioral, and structural contributors.
